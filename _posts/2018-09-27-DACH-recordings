More than 50 people from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland joined the meeting in Erlangen for interesting talks, networking and discussions, one of which lead to the emergence of an Moodle-Opencast subgroup to deal with the plugin developped by the University of MÃ¼nster.

Recordings of the meeting can be found in the [ETH video portal](https://www.video.ethz.ch/events/opencast/2018/erlangen.html).
